This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# RUNNING THE APP LOCALLY

## TODOS

- establish a workflow where you can add depedencies (via `npm install <dependency>`) without having to manually stop the container, rebuild, and restart.

## Initial Setup

Clone the repo and [install docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Run the app

> cd app

> docker-compose up -d --build

Go to `localhost:3000`. The app is running in watch mode.

`docker-compose` may be overkill right now since there is only one service, but we might add a lightweight node backend later.

## Stop the app

> docker-compose stop

## Alternative

You can create an image from the dockerfile directly if you don't want to use `docker-compose`

1. build the image

> docker build -t data-input-mvp:dev .

2. spin up a container from the image

```
docker run \
    -it \
    --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/app \
    -v /app/node_modules \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    -e CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true \
    data-input-mvp:dev
```

3. go to localhost:3000

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
